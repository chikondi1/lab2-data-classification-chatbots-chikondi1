Lab 2: Data Classification & Chatbots
This lab includes 2 scripts. The first one is classifying data when a user inputs a temperature in an integer value and the output displays if the temperature is hot, warm, cool, or cold. The second is a chatbot feature for a user to communicate with where inputs are user data and outputs allow them to see if they can get a drink from the bar.

#This function classifies which numerical temperature will go into which category.
def feelTemp(x):
  if x >= 100:
    print("It is hot")
  elif x >= 70 and x < 100:
    print("It is warm")
  elif x >= 32 and x < 70:
    print("It is cool")
  elif x < 32:
    print("It is cold")

#I added "int" to the beginning so that the program knows it is an integer as opposed to a string. 
feelTemp(x = int(input('Enter temperature: ')))

#This code allows a user to interact with a chatbot at a bar to see if they can get a drink.
name = input("Bot: Hello and welcome to Club Colab! What is your name? ") #allows user to input a string value when prompted
print("You:", name)
print("Bot: Hi", name,". Please enter your age if you would like a drink.") #bot uses string value input by user

#this function allows the bot to respond to the user if they are underage or if they are of age to get a drink.
class Age:
  def age(x): 
    if x > 20: #if age is over 20 then they will be met with a positive respond
      print("Bot: Over 21. Please grab your drink from the bar!")
    elif x < 20: #if age is below 21, they will be told to wait and it will show how many years to wait until they can get a drink
      x = 21-x
      print("Bot: Under 21. Sorry, please wait", x, "more years to have a drink from our bar.")

age(x = int(input("You: ")))
