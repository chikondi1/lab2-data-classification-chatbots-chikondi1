Lab 2: Data Classification & Chatbots
This lab includes 2 scripts. The first one is classifying data when a user inputs a temperature in an integer value and the output displays if the temperature is hot, warm, cool, or cold. The second is a chatbot feature for a user to communicate with where inputs are user data and outputs allow them to see if they can get a drink from the bar.

#This function classifies which numerical temperature will go into which category.
def feelTemp(x):
  if x >= 100:
    print("It is hot")
  elif x >= 70 and x < 100:
    print("It is warm")
  elif x >= 32 and x < 70:
    print("It is cool")
  elif x < 32:
    print("It is cold")

#I added "int" to the beginning so that the program knows it is an integer as opposed to a string. 
feelTemp(x = int(input('Enter temperature: ')))

#This code allows a user to interact with a chatbot at a bar to see if they can get a drink.

name = input("Bot: Hello and welcome to Club Colab! What is your name? ")
print("You:", name)
print("Bot: Hi", name,". Please enter your age if you would like a drink") #I wrote about drinks because I was talking about mojitos with my friend and suddenly when I tried it with writing drinks I finally got the code right so I left it like that.

age(x = int(input("You: "))) #I wanted to add a section where the user could choose yes or no if they wanted a drink but I found this part difficult to code, because one would proceed to the next step, and the other wouldn't. I'm still trying to figure out how to do this. 

#Writing this part of the code where you select your age was the easiest part for me (although not easy), because it had to do with integers, which we'd used before.
def age(x): 
  if x > 20:
    print("Bot: Over 21. Please grab your drink from the bar!")
  elif x < 20:
    x = 21-x
    print("Bot: Under 21. Sorry, please wait", x, "more years to have a drink from our bar.")

#I wanted to code an option so that if someone did not type an integer, it would say "sorry try again", and I tried and looked at quite a few other sources, but I couldn't figure it out.
