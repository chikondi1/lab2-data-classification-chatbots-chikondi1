# Lab 2 - Data Classification & Chatbots - Chikondi

This lab includes 2 scripts. The first one classifies temperature data. The user inputs a temperature in an integer value and the output displays if the temperature is hot, warm, cool, or cold. The second is a chatbot feature for a user to communicate with where inputs are user data and outputs allow them to see if they can get a drink from the bar. 

I found the temperature script straight forward to do and didn't have too much trouble writing it or figuring out where any minor problems were. The chatbot was a lot harder for me in terms of figuring out how to start and how to connect different parts of the chat. I read a lot of different sources so I could get a better idea of how to do it and they helped a bit. I had to go away and come back to it, so that I could look at it with a fresh mind and that helped me figure out small issues I had in the code. I think I need more practice with creating scripts like the chatbot script.

I tried to use these websites to help me write code if the user input a value that was not an integer, so that the code could ask the user to re-input a value that could be read.

I also tried to add another selection for the user to make on if they wanted a drink or not, but it was difficult for me to figure out how to proceed to the next step if they said yes, and how to end the chat if they said no. I want to keep working at that, but for now I can't figure it out.
