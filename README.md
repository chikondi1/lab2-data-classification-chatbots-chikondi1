# Lab 2 - Data Classification & Chatbots

This lab includes 2 scripts. The first one classifies temperature data. The user inputs a temperature in an integer value and the output displays if the temperature is hot, warm, cool, or cold. The second is a chatbot feature for a user to communicate with where inputs are user data and outputs allow them to see if they can get a drink from the bar.
